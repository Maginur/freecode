Step 5
You can have multiple meta elements on a web page. Each meta element adds information about the page that cannot be expressed by other HTML elements.

Add another meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to "viewport" and a content attribute set to "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" so your page looks the same on all devices.
